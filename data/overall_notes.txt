Data has been scraped or downloaded from various parts of Colorado's 
Energy & Carbon Management Commission ("ECMC") website: <https://ecmc.state.co.us>.

The ECMC oversees regulation of oil and gas operations in the State of
Colorado and provides data for free to the public.

Specifically, records have been pulled for some wells in Weld County, further
limited to the following contiguous townships (roughly 324 square miles):
 * T7N-R59W
 * T7N-R60W
 * T8N-R59W
 * T8N-R60W
 * T9N-R58W
 * T9N-R59W
 * T9N-R60W
 * T10N-R57W
 * T10N-R58W

These townships were selected because they have been densely drilled with
horizontal wells, the vast majority of which are drilled in the Niobrara
formation.
