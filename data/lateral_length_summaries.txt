Lateral length (ft), scraped and calculated from "scout cards" of wells,
accessed from the ECMC's website.

Measured TD: xxxx ft. (total depth)
Vertical TD: xxxx ft. (total depth)

Lateral length is [Measured TD] - [Vertical TD], if both are available.
If either is unavailable, the distance between SHL and BHL (calculated
elsewhere) is used instead.

This isn't perfectly accurate. Better would probably be 
[Measured TD] - [Top of Target Formation], but that isn't available for
many of these wells. I figured it was better to prioritize to consistency.
